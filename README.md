# README Generator

## Description

This project uses JavaScript and Node.js to create a dynamically generated README. Users answer prompts in the console to populate sections on installation, usage, contributions, testing, and contact information.

## Installation

Use of this application requires Node.js and the npm Inquirer be installed. From the console, run `node index` in the Develop folder.

## Usage

To use the application, run `node index` in the console within the Develop folder. Then, answer the questions and let JavaScript do the rest! Your markdown file will be generated and you can use it in any of your projects.

## Known Bugs

The application functions as written. The script will run and place your inputs into a generated markdown file. If you have a previously generated markdown file, the script will override the previously generated text.

However, opening the preview directly after generation may cause VS Code to open your previously generated markdown as the preview. Re-open your VS Code window and the preview will display the correct markdown.
